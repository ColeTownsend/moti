Expo Snack doesn't currently support SDK 44, which means it has an outdated version of Moti and Reanimated. This example uses that old version, so there is no web in the code.

<div data-snack-id="@nandorojo/moti-animate-height" data-snack-platform="mydevice" data-snack-preview="true" data-snack-theme="dark" style={{"overflow":"hidden",background:"#212121",border:"1px solid var(--color-border)",borderRadius:"4px",height:"505px",width:"100%"}}></div>
<script async src="https://snack.expo.dev/embed.js"></script>
